# Python dev tools

The Python dev tools bundles a couple of tools that are not part of the SDK (yet).
The SDK can be found at <https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-python-sdk>.

The dev tools are based on python libs:

* https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-ble
* https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-core
* https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-uart

If you are interested in creating your **own tools**, go to those repositories and study the example code there.
